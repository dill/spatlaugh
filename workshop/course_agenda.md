title: IWC spatial modelling pre-meeting

---


# Day 1

## Morning

- Intro talk on density surface modelling
  - Horvitz-Thompson estimation (good, bad, ugly) (~30 mins)
  - US east coast sperm whales DSM example (model formulation, estimation, model selection, uncertainty, etc) (~1 hour+)
  - Where can things go wrong? (spatial modelling is not a panacea) (~1 hour)

## Afternoon

- Practical considerations (when will Horvitz-Thompson fail? When will DSM fail?)
  - What is `ltdesigntester`?
  - Show off software on 1+ IWC examples (if none in time, sperm whales)
- DSM model checking (if it's reasonable and we can fit a model, how do we know it's not terrible?)


# Day 2

## Morning

- (Overview of) Things we haven't talked about
  - Group size & error
  - Availability & $g(0)$
  - Covariates beyond $x, y$
  - Temporal models, migration
  - Combining years
  - Combining platforms
- Workshop-y bit
  - People try out `ltdesigntester` with their data

## Afternoon

- What goes into guidelines?
- THE FUTURE!
  - Other software?
  - methods development?
