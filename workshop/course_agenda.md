title: IWC spatial modelling pre-meeting

---


# Day 1

## Morning

- Introductory talk on density surface modelling (DSM)
  - Horvitz-Thompson estimation (good, bad, ugly) (~30 mins)
  - US east coast sperm whales DSM example (model formulation, estimation, model selection, uncertainty, etc) (~1 hour+)
  - Where/when can things go wrong with spatial models? (spatial modelling is not a panacea) (~1 hour)

## Afternoon

- Practical considerations (when will Horvitz-Thompson fail? When will DSM fail?)
  - What is `ltdesigntester`? How can we test our data in R? (~1 hour)
  - Show off software on 1+ IWC examples (if none in time, sperm whale east coast data from NOAA) (~1 hour)
- DSM model checking (if it's reasonable and we can fit a model, how do we know it's not terrible?) (~1 hour)


# Day 2

## Morning

- Overview of things we haven't talked about (~1 hour)
  - Group size & error
  - Availability & $g(0)$
  - Covariates beyond spatial ($x, y$)
  - Temporal models, migration
  - Combining multi-year surveys
  - Combining platform surveys
- Workshop/practical (~1.5 hours)
  - Participants try out `ltdesigntester` with their data


## Afternoon

- Future developments (~1 hour)
  - Other software/software improvements
  - Methods (stats/design) development
- What goes into IWC guidelines?
