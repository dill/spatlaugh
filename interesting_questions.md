# Spatial modelling

- Multi-year repeated surveys -- what should you do?
- School size spatial variation
- How wrong is using quasi-Poisson?
- Lower bound on Tweedie p as 1.2?
- how should we visualise uncertainty?
* how can the fitted values from the varprop and normal model have maximum differences?
  - spatial variation in group size?

# Distance sampling

- How should we deal with $\text{Var}(\hat{p}(z_i))$ ?
  - *en masse* and individually
