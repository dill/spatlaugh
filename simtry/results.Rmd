# Simulation setup

- No group size issues -- everything is group size 1
- No issues with $\hat{g}(0)$



## Detection functions

## Spatial models

- Isotropic smooths
  - Thin plate spline (`bs="tp"`)
  - Thin plate spline with shrinkage (`bs="ts"`)
  - Duchon spline (`bs="ds", m=c(1, 0.5)`)
  - Thin plate spline with rotated covariates (`bs="tp"`)
- Tensor product smooths
  - Thin plate spline (`bs="tp"`)
  - Thin plate spline with rotated covariates (`bs="tp"`)

Where does the truth lie in the distribution of the model?

If we know $N_\text{truth}$ then at what quantile does it lie in the distribution implied by the model, so find $\mathbb{P}[N_\truth \leq \hat{N}]$. Here we assume log-normally distributed $\hat{N}$, so we can use `plnorm` in R to calculate the value we require. This summary statistic gives some idea of both bias and variance.

If the distribution of the statistic is skewed to either end then we can infer under or over estimation of abundance. Flat distribution is good, a "dome" in the middle indicates a conservative estimate (CIs slightly too wide), which we like.

# Results

```{r load-and-plot-results, echo=FALSE}
f_names <- c("f.RData", "lr.RData")#,"rl.RData")
load(f_names[2])
big_res$N <- big_res$V1
big_res$CV <- big_res$V2
big_res$V1 <- big_res$V2 <- NULL
big_res$se <- big_res$CV*big_res$N

p <- ggplot(big_res)+
  geom_histogram(aes(quantile))+
  facet_wrap(~names)

mm <- melt(big_res, id=c("iter", "names"))
p <- ggplot(mm)+
  geom_histogram(aes(value))+
  facet_wrap(variable~names, scales="free_x",ncol=7)#+
  #geom_vline(aes(xintercept=200))
print(p) 
```
